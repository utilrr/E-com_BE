Homework 13

## Description of Project

## Aims/Goals
1. Given a functional Express.js API, when I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, then I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize.
2. When I enter schema and seed commands, a development database is created and is seeded with test data.
3. When I enter the command to invoke the application, my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.
4. When I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
5. When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
